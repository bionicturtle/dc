This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(openintro)
data("hsb2")
# load("evals.RData")
# load("ucb_admit.RData")
# load("us_regions.RData")
```

Categorical data

* droplevels() removes unused factor levels

```{r}
table(hsb2$schtyp)

# pipe
# x %>% f(y) becomes f(x,y)
hsb2_public <- hsb2 %>% 
  filter(schtyp == "public")

3 %>% sum(4)

```

Discretize a varible
```{r}
# Calculate median number of characters: med_num_char
med_num_char <- median(email50$num_char)

# Create num_char_cat variable in email50
email50 <- email50 %>%
  mutate(num_char_cat = ifelse(num_char < med_num_char, "below median", "at or above median"))
  
# Count emails in each category
table(email50$num_char_cat)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Create number_yn column in email50
email50 <- email50 %>%
  mutate(number_yn = ifelse(number == "none", "no", "yes"))

# Visualize number_yn
ggplot(email50, aes(x = number_yn)) +
  geom_bar()

# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

# Scatterplot of exclaim_mess vs. num_char
ggplot(email50, aes(x = num_char, y = exclaim_mess, color = factor(spam))) +
  geom_point()
```

## 2. Observational studies and experiments

Explanatory (x) and response (y) variables

* Observational: only correlation
* Experiment: causation can be inferred (because confounding variables are probably equally distributed)

Random sampling: representative, can be generalized

Simpson's paradox

```{r}
load("ucb_admit.RData")
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Count number of male and female applicants admitted
ucb_counts <- ucb_admit %>%
  count(Gender, Admit)

# View result
ucb_counts

# Spread the output across columns
ucb_counts %>%
  spread(Admit, n)

```

```{r}
ucb_admit %>%
  # Table of counts of admission status and gender
  count(Gender, Admit) %>%
  # Spread output across columns based on admission status
  spread(Admit, n) %>%
  # Create new variable
  mutate(Perc_Admit = Admitted / (Admitted + Rejected))
```


```{r}
# Table of counts of admission status and gender for each department

admit_by_dept_not_spread <- ucb_admit %>%
  count(Dept, Gender, Admit)
admit_by_dept_not_spread


admit_by_dept <- ucb_admit %>%
  count(Dept, Gender, Admit) %>%
  spread(Admit, n)

# View result
admit_by_dept

# Percentage of those admitted to each department
admit_by_dept %>%
  mutate(Perc_Admit = Admitted / (Admitted + Rejected))
```

## 3. Sampling strategies

* Simple random sample: i.i.d from the population
* Stratified sampling: strata are homogenous WITHIN strata
* Cluster sampling: clusters are heterogeneous within cluster; e.g., divide a city into regions
* Multistage sampling: clusters, random samples, then sample within clusters

```{r}
library(openintro)
library(dplyr)
data("county")

county_noDC <- county %>%
  filter(state != "District of Columbia") %>%
  droplevels()

county_srs <- county_noDC %>%
  sample_n(size = 150)

country_strata <- county_noDC %>% # has same 3142 observations
  group_by(state)
# Most data operations are done on groups defined by variables. group_by() takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl where operations are performed "by group". ungroup() removes grouping.

country_str <- county_noDC %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  sample_n(size = 3)


```

Simple random sample in R
```{r}
load("us_regions.RData")
# Simple random sample: states_srs
states_srs <- us_regions %>%
  sample_n(size = 8)

# Count states by region
states_srs %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  count()
```

Stratified sample in R
```{r}
# Stratified sample
states_str <- us_regions %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  sample_n(size = 2)

# Count states by region
states_str %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  count()

```

Principles of experimental design

* Control
* Randomize
* Replicate
* Block
